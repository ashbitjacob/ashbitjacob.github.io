    <h1>RACEHORSE</h1>
<pre>O life, a determining race that runs to no end;
Hard filled path, some say; a fact undeniably true.
One night, all the stars in the grim sky belong to you;
In another, see your legs buckle until they bend.
A footrace with no other contender but yourself.
But at times you’ll have your peering eyes glance through the fence;
Making you distracted off your own steady footing,
Doubt flooding your reigns; You tip off of your feet’s rooting.
Caught a sight of the horses’ cubits far off from whence.
Regardless of who’s beyond the track, one shall not yield.
The bet on your racehorse is what determines your fate.
Run filled with pure certainty, walk with integrity;
Barring an injury, crawl through the mud of the field.
To live is to keep movement; To flow a steady rate.
Keep going, unyielding at a constant tendency.</pre>
